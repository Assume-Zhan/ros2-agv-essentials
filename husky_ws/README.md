## âœ¨ Introduction âœ¨

This repository has been derived from the Clearpath Husky's repository. [Here](https://github.com/husky/husky/tree/humble-devel) is the original repository.  
However, the original repository was designed for ROS1, and it is in the process of being upgraded to ROS2.

Below are the main packages for Husky:

- husky_base : Base configuration
- husky_control : Control configuration
- husky_description : Robot description (URDF)
- husky_navigation : Navigation configuration
- husky_gazebo : Simulate environment
- husky_viz : Visualize data

## ðŸš© Testing ðŸš©

### Building packages

Before attempting any examples, please remember to build the packages first.  
If you encounter any dependency errors, please use rosdep to resolve them.

```bash
cd /home/ros2-agv-essentials/husky_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro humble -y
colcon build
```

> After the build process, make sure to source the `install/setup.bash` file.  
> Otherwise, ROS2 will not locate the executable files. You can open a new terminal to accomplish this.

### View the model

```bash
ros2 launch husky_viz view_model_launch.py
```

<div align="center">
    <a href="./">
        <img src="./figure/view_model.png" width="80%"/>
    </a>
</div>

### Demonstration of SLAM.

```bash
ros2 launch husky_navigation slam_launch.py
```

> Rendering the model may take some time, so please be patient !
