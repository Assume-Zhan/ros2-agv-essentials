## âœ¨ Introduction âœ¨

This repository has been derived from the Clearpath Husky's repository. [Here](https://github.com/husky/husky/tree/humble-devel) is the original repository.  
However, the original repository was designed for ROS1, and it is in the process of being upgraded to ROS2.

Below are the main packages for Husky:

- husky_base : Base configuration
- husky_control : Control configuration
- husky_description : Robot description (URDF)
- husky_navigation : Navigation configuration
- husky_gazebo : Simulate environment
- husky_viz : Visualize data

## ðŸš© Testing ðŸš©

### Building packages

Before attempting any examples, please remember to build the packages first.  
If you encounter any dependency errors, please use rosdep to resolve them.

```bash
cd /home/ros2-essentials/husky_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro humble -y
colcon build
```

> After the build process, make sure to source the `install/setup.bash` file.  
> Otherwise, ROS2 will not locate the executable files. You can open a new terminal to accomplish this.

### View the model

```bash
ros2 launch husky_viz view_model_launch.py
```

<div align="center">
    <a href="./">
        <img src="./figure/view_model.png" width="80%"/>
    </a>
</div>

### Demonstration of SLAM.

```bash
ros2 launch husky_navigation slam_launch.py
```

> Rendering the model may take some time, so please be patient !

<div align="center">
    <a href="./">
        <img src="./figure/SLAM_1.png" width="80%"/>
        <img src="./figure/SLAM_2.png" width="80%"/>
    </a>
</div>

### Control real robot

> Before you proceed, please ensure that you've plugged the USB adapter of the Husky into the computer and mounted it into the container. (plugging in the USB adapter before creating the container is preferred but not required)

```bash=
# Move to the workspace, source .bashrc, and bringup husky.
cd /home/ros2-essentials/husky_ws
source ~/.bashrc
./script/husky-bringup.sh

# (Optional) Open a new terminal & control the robot via keyboard teleoperation.
./script/husky-teleop.sh
```
